# Supervised Learning -> "right answers" given

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

## Regression: Predict continuous valued output (price)

(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.

## Classification: Discrete valued output (0 or 1)

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
